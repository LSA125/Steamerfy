          <p>Steamify queries the free Steam API, grabs the games in each player's Steam library along with how many hours they have played it, and some metadata like images and names. It randomly generates a question based on the player's Steam library. If you find a bug, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:lsaweb277@gmail.com">lsaweb277&#64;gmail.com</a>.</p>
